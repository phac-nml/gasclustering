# phac-nml/gasclustering: Changelog

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2024-11-07

- Added the ability to include a `sample_name` column in the input samplesheet.csv. Allows for compatibility with IRIDA-Next input configuration.

  - `sample_name` special characters (non-alphanumeric with exception of "_" and ".") will be replaced with `"_"`
  - If no `sample_name` is supplied in the column `sample` will be used
  - To avoid repeat values for `sample_name` all `sample_name` values will be suffixed with the unique `sample` value from the input file

  - Fixed linting issues in CI caused by nf-core 3.0.1

## [0.3.0] - 2024-09-10

### Changed

- Upgraded `profile_dist` container to version `1.0.2`
- Upgraded `locidex/merge` to version `0.2.3` and updated `input_assure` and test data for compatibility with the new `mlst.json` allele file format.
  - [PR28](https://github.com/phac-nml/gasclustering/pull/28)
- Aligned container registry handling in configuration files and modules with `phac-nml/pipeline-standards`
  - [PR28](https://github.com/phac-nml/gasclustering/pull/28)

This pipeline is now compatible only with output generated by [Locidex v0.2.3+](https://github.com/phac-nml/locidex) and [Mikrokondo v0.4.0+](https://github.com/phac-nml/mikrokondo/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

## [0.2.0] - 2024-06-26

### Added

- Support for mismatched IDs between the samplesheet ID and the ID listed in the corresponding allele file.

### Changed

- Updated ArborView to v0.0.7-rc1.

### Fixed

- The scaled distance thresholds provided when using `--pd_distm scaled` and `--gm_thresholds` are now correctly understood as percentages in the range [0.0, 100.0].

## [0.1.0] - 2024-05-28

Initial release of the Genomic Address Service Clustering pipeline to be used for distance-based clustering of cg/wgMLST data.

### `Added`

- Input of cg/wgMLST allele calls produced from [locidex](https://github.com/phac-nml/locidex).
- Output of a dendrogram, cluster codes, and visualization using [profile_dists](https://github.com/phac-nml/profile_dists), [gas mcluster](https://github.com/phac-nml/genomic_address_service), and ArborView.
